      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Odunayo Ayinla</strong>, but you can call me <strong>Voltage Lord</strong>.  
        As a passionate developer with a strong focus on API building, frontend development, and Node.js,  
        I've been driving innovation in the tech space since 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey began as a learner under the guidance of experienced developers, where I honed my skills  
        and gained valuable insights. In 2022, I partnered with <strong>Silent</strong>, the developer of Demon Killer V5,  
        a WhatsApp bot. Although our partnership was short-lived due to unforeseen issues, it sparked  
        a new wave of determination within me.
      </p>

      <p>
        In January 2023, I embarked on a new challenge: mastering Python to build robust APIs.  
        This journey has been transformative, and I'm proud to showcase some of my notable projects below.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of tech.  
        Let's connect and explore how we can create something amazing together!
      </p>
